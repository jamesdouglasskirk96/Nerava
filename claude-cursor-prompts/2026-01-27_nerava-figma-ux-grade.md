CLAUDE PROMPT — Grade UX Quality (Nerava‑Figma‑With‑Amenities)

You are Claude Code. Grade the quality of the user experience in the Nerava‑Figma‑With‑Amenities prototype.

Context:
- Focus on UX only (clarity, flow, hierarchy, affordances, consistency, feedback, error states, accessibility, and polish).
- You can infer from the existing UI/screens in the Nerava‑Figma‑With‑Amenities project.
- Keep scope to the current design; do not propose major redesigns.

Your output MUST include:
1) Overall UX score (0–10)
2) 3 strongest UX wins (specific, concrete)
3) 3 most critical UX gaps (specific, concrete)
4) Top 3 improvements that would raise the score (actionable, scoped)
5) Quick “ship readiness” verdict for UX only (e.g., “ship with minor tweaks” vs “needs polish”)

Keep it brief and structured.
