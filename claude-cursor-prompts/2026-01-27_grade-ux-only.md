CLAUDE PROMPT — Grade UX Only (Driver App)

You are Claude Code. Grade ONLY the user experience quality based on the changes summary below. Do NOT comment on code quality, architecture, performance, or implementation details. Treat the summary as ground truth.

UX Changes Summary (scope for grading):

- Empty states for PreCharging and WhileYouCharge screens

- Accessibility fundamentals: aria-labels, role/status labels, reduced motion support, 44x44 touch targets, focus-visible outlines, pagination labels

Your output MUST include:
1) Overall UX score (0–10)
2) 3 strongest UX wins (specific)
3) 3 critical UX gaps (specific)
4) Top 3 UX improvements to raise the score (scoped and actionable)
5) UX-only ship readiness verdict (e.g., “ship with minor tweaks”)

Constraints:
- Keep it brief and structured.
- No code review or technical critique.
