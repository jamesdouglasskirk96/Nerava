- Onboarding flow(s) (merchant onboarding, claim flow, any onboarding screens in apps/merchant)

Your output MUST include:
1) UX score (0–10) for merchant portal + onboarding
2) Top 3 UX wins
3) Top 3 UX gaps (with file paths)
4) Production readiness verdict (ship / needs fixes)
5) A short Cursor‑ready implementation plan for the top gaps

Constraints:
